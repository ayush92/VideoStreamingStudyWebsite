            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In our previous study related to streaming video content online, we have studied the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) protocol and its effectiveness in streaming high quality media. This approach to video streaming adjusts the video quality delivery to the client player based on changing network conditions. We had participants view video content streamed over a controlled network to study user satisfaction with DASH based algorithms. Our previous study is documented <a href="http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jmarty/projects/VideoStreamingAssessments/VideoStreamingAssessments.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Considering the results fromt the last study, we decided to test 2 DASH based algorithms in our current study. The purpose of this study is to make sure that we are moving in the right direction in developing an optimal DASH video streaming algorithm.</p>
            <h2 id="goals">Project Goals</h2>
            <p>1. To determine which of the two DASH implementations of the algorithm are prefered more by users.<br>2. To determine user satisfaction with the quality of video streamed over the internet using DASH.</p>
            <h2 id="methodology">Project Methodology</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this research is to observe user satisfaction with the quality of an online movie streamed over a simulated cable network that has been purposefully ingested with varied levels of congestion. The will be a two-fold study. The first part of the study will be a formal study conducted at Clemson Univeristy in a theater like setup. A between subjects design is being used for the this part. The independent variables that are used in this design are the levels of impairment in the content and the algorithm used to render the video. This results in 4 unique settings and each setting will be viewed by 15 participants. The video clips for each setting will be pre-recorded to maintain consistency between the content viewed by the participants in the same setting.</p>
            <p>Each participant will be asked to attend two sessions. In the first session, a signature exempt informed consent will be given, followed by a pre-survey, a short movie, Tears of Steel, about 20 minutes in duration and then a post-survey. The movie has been release under the Creative Commons license which is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work that they have created. The participant will also be asked to continuously provide feedback on the quality and aritfacts in the movie by means of  a dial or a clicker.</p>
            <p>For the second session, the participant will be asked to watch another clip using the same level of impairment but a different algorithm and then fill a post-survey. The participant will be asked to attend the second session on a different day. A temperament questionnaire and a personality questionnaire will also be completed by the participant before both sessions. Once the formal study is complete the results will be statistically analyzed and the conclusion will be shared in academic publications, conference presentations, and an evaluation report to our funders.</p>
            <p>For the second part of the study, the clips from the 4 different settings will be hosted on the internet and users will be asked to view these and provide responses. They will be presented with an informed consent upon clicking a link, then they will view one of the 4 clips randomly selected by a script and then fill out the same post-survey as used for the formal study. These responses will be anonymous.</p>
